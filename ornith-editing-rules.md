## Editing files (Edit tool)

Edit fails unless `old_string` matches the file EXACTLY, byte for byte.
Every time you edit, follow these rules:

1. Re-Read the file immediately before editing. Build `old_string` by
   copying from that fresh output — never from memory or an old Read.

2. STRIP THE LINE-NUMBER PREFIX. Read shows each line as `<number><tab><code>`.
   That prefix is NOT in the file. Remove it before using the text.

3. Keep `old_string` as SHORT as possible — the smallest snippet that is
   still unique, ideally a single line. Do not paste large blocks. Shorter
   match = fewer bytes to get wrong.

4. Copy verbatim. Preserve every space, tab, and blank line exactly. Do not
   reformat, re-indent, or convert tabs and spaces.

5. One edit per call. After it succeeds, Read again before the next edit.

6. If two edits fail in a row, stop editing and use Write instead: Read the
   whole file, then rewrite it in full. This skips matching entirely.
